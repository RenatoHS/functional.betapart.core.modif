new.functional.betapart

A faster version of the functional.betapart.core from the "betapart" package in R. The function is used to decompose the functional beta-diversity of communities into the turnover and nestedness components, and it is an extension of the original method that was designed for the taxonomic perspective.

This new version allows for external parallelization and is substantially faster than the original one when dealing with # large community matrices.
